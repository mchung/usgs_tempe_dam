Hello,

On 7/20/2010, between 9:45 and 10:00 p.m. MST, the dam at the west end of 
Tempe Town Lake broke spilling thousands of gallons of water into the 
adjacent salt bed.

The USGS has all sorts of sensors allowing people to get an idea of various
reports, such as the discharge rate

This code calculates the total volume discharged based on the USGS RDB API
