Hello,

On 7/20/2010, between 9:45 and 10:00 p.m. MST, the dam at the west end of 
Tempe Town Lake broke spilling thousands of gallons of water into the 
adjacent salt bed.

The USGS has all sorts of sensors allowing people to get various readings,
such as the discharge rate

This code calculates the total volume discharged based on the USGS RDB API

As of Wed Jul 21 01:19:16 MST 2010

Total volume of Tempe Town Lake: 126,779,654 cubic feet
Total volume discharged        : 93,904,200 cubic feet
